Wardle
=======

A Wordle bot / playground thingy that I put together for some reason. Also another project for SwiftUI experimentation. I named it before I knew that the guy who invented Wordle was named Wardle but I'm too lazy to come up with another name and hopefully he doesn't mind. My solution mechanism is out of my own head, which was part of the fun of messing with this, so probably isn't great but it's not awful either.
